                            Moves is a new social networking app that allows users to see where their friends are and share events on a map. 
                            Users can easily see events on the map, find out which ones their friends are going to, and RSVP.

                            The purpose of Moves Web (this website) is to allow all types of organizations, including bars, clubs, restaurants, college organizations,
                            and more, to post their own events to the map, reaching a wide userbase with ease. The process is easy: <br><br>
                            1. To sign up, enter the relevant information and wait for us to approve your account (this should take less than 24 hours). <br><br>
                            2. As soon as you're approved, you can log in and start posting events on the map. Just click "Create Event" and enter the relevant details.
                            Your events can be public or private, free or ticketed (in which case users can buy tickets through the map!). <br><br>
                            3. Once created, users can see your event on the map, RSVP, tell their friends they're going, and buy tickets. Meanwhile, 
                            you can to access real-time data through the website, including but not limited to how many people have RSVP'd,
                            ticket revenue, and key demographic breakdowns.<br><br>
